## Usage test
Create a file called test.yaml in the `.github/workflows` directory or go to your repository where your workflows file is located.

## Try rego query from CI integration
I partially cut out the opa cli part of the query processing that is combined with the static analysis processing.
set your `.github/workflows` dir any name (example : query.yaml)
